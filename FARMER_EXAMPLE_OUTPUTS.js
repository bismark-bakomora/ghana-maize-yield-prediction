// EXAMPLE OUTPUT - What Farmers Will See After Prediction

/**
 * For a farm with these inputs:
 * - District: Kumasi Metropolitan
 * - Rainfall: 420mm (below optimal)
 * - Temperature: 32°C (too hot)
 * - Humidity: 60%
 * - Sunlight: 5 hours (low)
 * - Soil Moisture: 0.35 (very dry)
 * - Pest Risk: 65% (high)
 * - PFJ Policy: Not enrolled
 * - Previous Yield: 2.2 Mt/Ha
 */

// PREDICTED YIELD: 1.3 Mt/Ha
// CATEGORY: Low 📉
// CONFIDENCE: 72% (Range: 0.95 - 1.65 Mt/Ha)

/**
 * === WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOUR FARM ===
 * 
 * Your predicted harvest is below average (1.3 Mt/Ha). 
 * Compared to last year's 2.2 Mt/Ha, this represents a 
 * decrease of 41%. Focus on improving soil health and 
 * pest management.
 */

/**
 * === QUICK SUMMARY ===
 * 💡 We are confident (72%) your farm will produce 
 * around 1.3 Mt/Ha.
 */

/**
 * === DETAILED ACTION PLAN ===
 * 
 * 1. 🌧️ Critical water shortage detected. Install drip 
 *    irrigation or rainwater harvesting systems to maximize 
 *    available moisture. This is your highest priority.
 * 
 * 2. 🏜️ Soil is very dry. Add organic compost or manure 
 *    to improve water-holding capacity. This will help plants 
 *    access water better during dry periods.
 * 
 * 3. 🌡️ Temperature stress is a concern. Provide shade 
 *    where possible, ensure adequate water supply, and 
 *    consider heat-tolerant varieties for future seasons.
 * 
 * 4. ☀️ Low sunlight hours detected. Remove any shade-causing 
 *    obstacles or trees. Maize needs at least 6-8 hours of 
 *    direct sunlight daily for optimal growth.
 * 
 * 5. 🦗 High pest risk identified. Implement integrated pest 
 *    management: scout fields regularly, use resistant varieties, 
 *    apply organic or approved pesticides early. Training 
 *    available through extension services.
 * 
 * 6. 📋 PFJ (Planting for Food and Jobs) Policy support is 
 *    NOT active. Enroll in PFJ to access free improved seeds, 
 *    fertilizers, and extension services. Contact your district 
 *    agricultural office for enrollment.
 * 
 * 7. 📚 Your yield is significantly below potential. Schedule 
 *    a consultation with your district extension officer to assess 
 *    soil nutrients, pest problems, and management practices. 
 *    Consider soil testing.
 * 
 * 8. 📈 Your yield is expected to drop by 0.9 Mt/Ha compared 
 *    to last year. Investigate what changed—review weather, pests, 
 *    soil conditions, and management practices to identify issues.

/**
 * === IDENTIFIED RISK FACTORS ===
 * • Low rainfall
 * • High temperature stress
 * • Low soil moisture
 * • High pest risk
 */

/**
 * === WHAT FARMERS UNDERSTAND ===
 * 
 * Instead of thinking "1.3 Mt/Ha - I don't know what that means"
 * 
 * They now understand:
 * ✓ "My harvest will be much worse than last year"
 * ✓ "The main problems are: not enough water, too hot, bugs"
 * ✓ "I should get irrigation and join the PFJ program"
 * ✓ "I need to add compost and use pest control"
 * ✓ "I should talk to the agricultural extension officer"

// ------ ANOTHER EXAMPLE: GOOD YIELD ------

/**
 * For a farm with:
 * - Rainfall: 800mm (good)
 * - Temperature: 27°C (ideal)
 * - Humidity: 70%
 * - Sunlight: 7 hours (good)
 * - Soil Moisture: 0.65 (ideal)
 * - Pest Risk: 15% (low)
 * - PFJ Policy: Enrolled
 * - Previous Yield: 2.1 Mt/Ha
 */

// PREDICTED YIELD: 2.4 Mt/Ha
// CATEGORY: Good ✅
// CONFIDENCE: 85% (Range: 1.93 - 2.87 Mt/Ha)

/**
 * === WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOUR FARM ===
 * 
 * Your predicted harvest is good (2.4 Mt/Ha)! This is solid 
 * production. Compared to last year's 2.1 Mt/Ha, you're up by 14%. 
 * Continue your current practices with minor adjustments.
 */

/**
 * === DETAILED ACTION PLAN ===
 * 
 * 1. ✅ Rainfall levels are good. Maintain consistent moisture 
 *    levels through regular monitoring and light irrigation as needed.
 * 
 * 2. 💧 Soil moisture is in the ideal range. Continue monitoring 
 *    and adjust watering based on rainfall and crop growth stage.
 * 
 * 3. 🌤️ Temperature conditions are favorable for maize growth. 
 *    Maintain this by protecting crops from extreme weather.
 * 
 * 4. ☀️ Sunlight levels are excellent. Continue to maintain 
 *    clear fields to maximize photosynthesis.
 * 
 * 5. ✅ Pest risk is low. Continue regular field monitoring 
 *    and maintain good farm hygiene practices.
 * 
 * 6. ✅ You are enrolled in the PFJ program. Ensure you collect 
 *    all available inputs and attend training sessions to maximize 
 *    benefits.
 * 
 * 7. 🎯 You're on track for good yields. Fine-tune your practices: 
 *    ensure timely planting, maintain proper plant spacing, and use 
 *    quality seeds and fertilizers.
 * 
 * 8. 📊 Your yield is expected to improve by 0.3 Mt/Ha compared 
 *    to last year. Great progress! Identify what worked better this 
 *    season and maintain those practices.

/**
 * === FARMER UNDERSTANDING ===
 * 
 * ✓ "My harvest will be good, even better than last year"
 * ✓ "Everything is working well for me"
 * ✓ "I should keep doing what I'm doing"
 * ✓ "Make sure I get all my PFJ inputs"
 * ✓ "Focus on proper spacing and good seeds"
